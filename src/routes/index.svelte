<h1> About Me </h1>

<p>
I have developed algorithms for extraction of one or more signals embedded in multivariate time series. The concept of signal-to-noise is defined and optimized over a certain class of models. In this vein, I work closely within and around the domain known as linear dimensionality reduction, which includes methods like Principal Component Analysis and Multivariate Statistical Analysis.

I have also developed methods for extracting signals for incomplete multivariate time series, for example time series with different sampling intervals or missing data, a common feature of real life data sets. Here, I infer the missing data points while extracting a smooth underlying signal. This outperforms traditional algorithms for data imputation because we take advantage of the underlying time structure.
