This study is looking at the association between excess mortality and vaccination rates. One would expect vaccination to decrease overall mortality in a population but sometimes we see the opposite (Figure 1). Especially the booster doses are closely related to increased mortality. Four countries are picked out as case studies, while the remaining countries are plotted in the appendix. However, not all countries have the same strong association with mortality. This is likely because only 5% of the vaccine batches appear to have produced [90% of the adverse reactions](https://www.howbadismybatch.com). Some Pfizer batches are associated with 30 x the number of deaths and disabilities compared to other batches.

  <b> Figure 1 </b> <i> Excess mortality plotted against weekly booster vaccination doses for ages 15+ from 2020-2022: Mortality is plotted in % (in black) and is age standardized to the European Standard Population (100k). Baseline mortality rates are calculated from the period 2013-2019, or the latest available data. Vaccination doses (red) are 3rd or higher dose for an individual.  </i>

The two trendlines (in gold) are annual and weekly trends, where the annual is a polynomial before 2020 (natural spline w/ 2 degrees of freedom) and constant after 2020 and the weekly trend is another polynomial (spline) with periodic constraints and 4 degrees of freedom across the 52 weeks of the year fitted in the period before 2020. </i>
