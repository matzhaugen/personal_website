On transmissibility of virus (not the scope of the paper)
---
I was recently made aware of an interesting paper by the CDC where they provide evidence against their own pathogenicity theory of the covid virus, as shown in the excerpt below ([Harcourt et al., 2020](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/6/20-0516_article)):

"*Therefore, we examined the capacity of SARS-CoV-2 to infect and replicate in several common primate and human cell lines, including human adenocarcinoma cells (A549), human liver cells (HUH7.0), and human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293T), in addition to Vero E6 and Vero CCL81 cells. We also examined an available big brown bat kidney cell line (EFK3B) for SARS-CoV-2 replication capacity. Each cell line was inoculated at high multiplicity of infection and examined 24 h postinfection (Figure 3, panel A). **No [cytopathic effect] was observed in any of the cell lines except in Vero cells**, which grew to >107 PFU at 24 h postinfection. In contrast, HUH7.0 and 293T cells showed only modest viral replication, and A549 cells were incompatible with SARS-CoV-2 infection.*"
