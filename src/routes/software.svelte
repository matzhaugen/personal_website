			Provides a function that calculates an estimate of the covariance matrix shrunk using a non-linear analytic formula provided by
			the working paper Ledoit and Wolf (2018), entitled <a href="http://www.econ.uzh.ch/static/wp/econwp264.pdf"> Analytical Nonlinear Shrinkage of Large-Dimensional Covariance Matrices</a>.

		<li> <a href="https://mahaugen.shinyapps.io/shinyapp2/">Temperature distribution app</a>: An app that shows the geopgraphic trends of daily average temperature. The data is from
the Community Earth System Model and the accompanying paper is submitted with title "Assessing changes in
temperature distributions using ensemble model simulations" and authors Matz A. Haugen, Michael L. Stein, Ryan L.
Sriver, Elisabeth J. Moyer.
