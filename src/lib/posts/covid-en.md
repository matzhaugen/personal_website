The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), who approved the vaccine for Pfizer, has been asked in a US court to present all the documents involved in the approval process of the vaccine. In response, the FDA requests to wait until 2096 to comply, according to [Aaron Siri](https://aaronsiri.substack.com/p/fda-doubles-down-asks-federal-judge) who is the lawyer in the case. Why would the FDA need this much time to present documents they spent 108 days on reading before approving the vaccine?


It may have something to do with the fact that in the first part of the documents that have already been released, 42,000 adverse events have been reported in the period December 2020 to the end of February 2021, which was the study period used by Pfizer ([FDA-2021](https://phmpt.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/5.3.6-postmarketing-experience.pdf)). The FDA has [chosen](https://trialsitenews.com/fdas-forced-hand-drops-pfizers-bombshell-safety-document/) to keep the number of doses given during this period secret, so it is impossible to calculate an incidence rate, but Pfizer [earned](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/07/13/covid-19-vaccines-how-much-revenue-in-2021/) around $ 40 billion on the covid vaccine in 2021 and have [liability](https://aaronsiri.substack.com/p/covid-19-vaccine-manufacturers-can) immunity for adverse effects claims, so they might not be in a hurry to divulge more information. And when former FDA director [Scott Gottlieb](https://www.pfizer.com/people/leadership/board-of-directors/scott_gottlieb-md) sits on the board of Pfizer, and the FDA [receives](https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/fda-basics/fact-sheet-fda-glance) 45% of the budget from industry, things can get complicated. 

Problems with the study surfaced recently in *The British Medical Journal* (BMJ), where journalist Paul Thacker [reports](https://www.bmj.com/content/375/bmj.n2635) November 2, 2021, that several test stations in Texas falsified data, used unqualified personnel and were slow to process adverse event reports. An employee was concerned about the development and submitted a complaint to the FDA. She was fired the same day. Peter Doshi, professor at the University of Maryland and editor of BMJ, was already in January 2021 critical of the vaccine study when he [wrote](https://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2021/01/04/peter-doshi-pfizer-and-modern-95-effective-vaccines-we-need-more-details-and-the-raw-data/) that if you only look at clinical symptoms without a PCR test, the effectiveness of the vaccine will drop to 29%. Not exactly something to brag about, especially not when the cutoff value for approval is 50%, set by the FDA, i.e. a halving of the risk of disease between the treatment and the placebo groups. 

But efficiency and relative risk reduction does not provide information about the incidence rate in the population of patients. For that we need to look at absolute risk, i.e. the number of covid-positive cases in the two groups, treatment and placebo. [R. Brown (2021)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33652582/) showed that the absolute risk difference between the two groups is a meager 0.7%. The stark difference between the 29% relative risk reduction above and the 0.7% absolute risk reduction is because the vast majority of both treatment and control test covid negative. 

But disease cases do not give information about the vaccine's ability to prevent death from covid. There was one death reportedly from covid in the treatment group, while the placebo group had two deaths (see [Table S4](https://bit.ly/3H6XSPP)). With each group having 22,000 people, this is not sufficient to conduct a statistical analysis on, so one is left to conclude that the ability of the vaccine to prevent death from covid is inconclusive at best, absent at worst. The all-cause mortality was in fact higher by one death in the treatment group (15 vs 14).

One notable category of adverse effects of the vaccine is cardiac related issues, especially in [younger people](https://openvaers.com/covid-data/myo-pericarditis). In a paper recently published in the journal *Circulation*, [S. Gundry (2021)](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/circ.144.suppl_1.10712) finds that mRNA vaccines increase markers of endothelial inflammation and T-cell infiltration of the heart muscle and may explain the observations of increased thrombosis, cardiomyopathy and other vascular events after vaccination. Gundry sees a 2.5-fold increase in the 5-year risk of acute heart problems after vaccination. People who are injured by the vaccines have taken the matter into their own hands to share their story (e.g. [vaxtestimonies.org](https://vaxtestimonies.org/en/)).

This is also reflected in the US Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) which has registered over 8500 heart-related events within the USA ([openvaers.com](https://openvaers.com/covid-data)). These cases are voluntarily submitted by patients and some of these events may of course be unrelated to the vaccine. Using the estimate that [72% of the 330 million](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations) Americans are at least partially vaccinated, only around 36 per million vaccinated have registered events in VAERS. 

However, there are studies that indicate that the adverse events in VAERS are underrepresented. For example, [Baker et al. al (2015)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6642796/) found in a study published in *Clinical Infectious Diseases* that if one improves the VAERS system with an electronic component, the reporting rate will increase 30 times. In that case, heart problems would have affected close to 1,000 / million vaccinated. But this was a study that came out before people were forced to take the vaccine, so one must reckon that the reporting rate must be adjusted somewhat. In addition, the severity of the side effect will probably increase the likelihood that someone would report it. For example, there are 9,000 deaths registered in the US due to the covid vaccine in VAERS. It is conceivable that this is more accurately reported. The same can be said about the 10,000 permanent paralyses that have been registered. 

One can also ask how many of the reports are not from the vaccines, and therefore a "false" adverse effect from the vaccine. To answer this question, one can look at the timing of the case and compare with when the vaccine was given. If there is no connection between the vaccine and the alleged side effect, one would expect *not* to see that the time of vaccine administration and the time of the adverse event have any connection. Neil Miller had exactly this hypothesis when he studied infant mortality and vaccination in the article *Vaccines and sudden infant death: An analysis of the VAERS database 1990â€“2019* published in the journal *Toxicology Reports*. Within a 60-day reporting window, he found that 58% of deaths recorded in VAERS occurred within 3 days of vaccination and 78% of deaths occurred within one week ([Miller 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214750021001268)). This is significantly more than expected with a steady death rate of 12% after 7 days. A similar analysis can be done for the covid vaccine where deaths are registered more frequently within the first few days; 1818 on the day of the vaccine, 1630 one day after, 1081 two days after, and so on until 32 deaths 75 days after the vaccine ([vaersanalysis.info, 3-12-21](https://vaersanalysis.info/2021/12/11/vaers-summary-for-covid-19-vaccines-through-12-03-2021/)). 

For doctors, the Hippocratic oath could become a liability, but it is difficult to stop vaccinating patients if you want to keep your job.
